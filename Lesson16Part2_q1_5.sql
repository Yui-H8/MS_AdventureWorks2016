/*
1. For the purpose of learning, create a function called fnFuncLearning and follow the
 instructions in the following sections:
 (If the function was not deleted in the previous part of the exercise, update the
 function using "alter").
*/
/*
a. The function will take two parameters of data type int.
 b. Within the function, define a variable of type integer (int) and give it a name of
 your choice.
 c. The function will insert the result of the product of the two received
 parameters into the variable.
 d. The function will returnsthe variable that has been defined as the returned
 value.
 Call the function and send a parameter to it. Check that the result is correct

 2. Create a function called fnGetOrderCustomer that takes a parameter, Order number
 (int data type), and returns the customer number from that order (int data type).
 Think of a way to check that the function is working properly, and verify that the
 result is accurate.
 3. Continue on from the previous question. In order to check the accuracy of the
 function, run the two queries below and compare the results.
 One query uses the function
 The other query performs the same calculation as the function.

 4. Create a new function called fnGetProductOrderAmount, which takes a ProductID
