7. Continuing from the previous section, the function will be used in 3 different
 queries.
 Write a query for each of the following sections:

/*
 a. In order to check the accuracy of the function, run it with fixed parameters
 and, at the same time, calculate the expected result manually, to make sure
 that the results are identical.
 Send the following values to the function:
 Price = 100, Cost = 30, Qty = 10
 Calculate the answer manually, and check to be sure that the query returns the
 correct answer

b. Explore the theoretical profit from each of the products in the product table.
 Send the function the following values:
 list price, item cost, and quantity = 1.
 Run the query only on products that have a value for price (price higher than
 0)

 displays the following columns

 two ways to calculate this value.), item cost (from the Product table), profit per
 sales record (by calling the function and sending the appropriate parameters)
